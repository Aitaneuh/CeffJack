                <p>
                    The goal of Blackjack is to beat the dealer by getting a hand value as close as possible to <strong>21</strong> without going over.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Card Values</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
                    <li>Number cards are worth their face value (2â€“10).</li>
                    <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth <strong>10</strong> points.</li>
                    <li>Aces are worth <strong>1 or 11</strong>, whichever is more favorable for your hand.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">How to Play</h3>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1">
                    <li>You start with two cards. The dealer also gets two cards (one hidden).</li>
                    <li>You can choose to:
                        <ul class="ml-4 list-disc">
                            <li><strong>Hit</strong>: draw another card.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stand</strong>: keep your current hand.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If your hand exceeds 21, you <strong>bust</strong> and lose.</li>
                    <li>When you stand, the dealer reveals their hidden card and draws until reaching at least 17.</li>
                    <li>Whoever is closer to 21 without busting wins. A tie is a <strong>push</strong>.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Blackjack</h3>
                <p>
                    A "Blackjack" is when your first two cards are an Ace and a 10-point card. It's the best possible hand!
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Important Notes</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
                    <li>If both the player and the dealer bust, the dealer wins.</li>
                    <li>The dealer must hit until they reach at least 17.</li>
                    <li>No splitting, doubling down or insurance is available in this simplified version.</li>
